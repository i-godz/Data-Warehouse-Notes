## What is Data Modeling 
- Process of creating a conceptual representation of the structure and relationships of data within a specific domain.
- Involves identifying entities, attributes, and relationships to create a model that accurately reflects how data is organized and how it interacts within a system or organization.
- Serves as a blueprint for database design and helps ensure that data is organized efficiently, accurately, and in a way that meets the needs of the business or application.

## Types of Data Modeling 

### Conceptual

![[conceptual-data-modeling.png]]

- Defines ==what== the system contains.
- Represents a high-level and abstract understanding of business concepts.
- Focus on entities and their relationships without getting into technical details.

### Logical

- Defines ==how== the system should be implemented regardless the DMBS.
- Less abstract, translate the conceptual model into more detailed structure.
- Focus on the technical mapping of constraints rules and data structures.
- Involves normalization for data integrity.

### Physical

- Defines ==how== the system should be implemented using specific DMBS.
- Least abstract.
- Represent tables, columns, indexes, data types, indexes and other database specific structure.

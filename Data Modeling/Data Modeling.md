## What is Data Modeling 
- Process of creating a conceptual representation of the structure and relationships of data within a specific domain.
- Involves identifying entities, attributes, and relationships to create a model that accurately reflects how data is organized and how it interacts within a system or organization.
- Serves as a blueprint for database design and helps ensure that data is organized efficiently, accurately, and in a way that meets the needs of the business or application.

- Defines ==how== the system should be implemented regardless the DMBS.
- Less abstract.
- Focus on the technical mapping of rules and data structures.
- Involves normalization for data integrity.
